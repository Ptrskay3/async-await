# Why concurrency is important?

<br>

<div v-click>

In the real world, you see complex independently behaving pieces.

<br>

Sequential software you write _does not_ model the real world's behavior well enough.

</div>

---

# Concurrency is not parallelism

..although it may enable parallelism.

<img src="/eggs.png" class="absolute bottom-0 left-170 w-50 transform -rotate-10" />

<p v-click>

## An analogy

You need to fry 5 eggs. To cook an egg you crack it onto the griddle, wait for a few minutes, then take it off.

</p>

---

# Concurrency is not parallelism

<br>

- The <text class="font-extrabold text-transparent text-md bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-red-600">sequential</text> approach is to fry the first egg to completion, then fry the second egg to completion, and so on, until you have 5 fried eggs.

<br>

<div v-click>

- The <text class="font-extrabold text-transparent text-md bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-red-600">parallel</text> approach is to hire 5 cooks, tell each of them to fry an egg, and wait until they are all finished.

</div>

<br>

<div v-click>

- The <text class="font-extrabold text-transparent text-md bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-red-600">concurrent</text> approach is that you cook all 5 eggs yourself the way you would actually do it. That is, you quickly crack each egg onto the pan, then take each one off when it's ready.

</div>
<br>

<div v-click>

- The <text class="font-extrabold text-transparent text-md bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-red-600">concurrent and parallel</text> approach is to hire multiple cooks, and tell them to cook the eggs efficiently, as you would do in reality.

</div>

# Concurrency is not parallelism

<br>

<h3>
Did I choose the task of "frying eggs" by accident?
</h3>

<br>
<br>

<h3 v-click>No.</h3>
<br>
<br>

<h4 v-click>The number of cooks wasn't what was limiting you from going faster.</h4>

# IO-bound vs CPU-bound

<br>

Some tasks require work <text class="font-bold font-italic">from us</text> to complete. These are <text class="font-extrabold text-transparent text-md bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-red-600">CPU-bound</text> tasks.

# TODO: Mention executors, but not here maybe

---

# What is concurrency?

Concurrency is being able to break your program into tasks and then interleave these tasks.

Concurrency is a way to structure software, particularly as a way to write clean code that interacts well with the real world.

It is not parallelism. Parallelism is different. (this line is unnecessary I guess)

# TODO: bring in leaky abstractions and the pendulum stuff..

# Also TODO: mention that CPU is much faster than network, memory, disk, etc..

---

# Preemptive vs cooperative

---

# Why concurrency is hard?

- simple vs double pendulum example ->

---

# Concurrency

Concurrent programming is less mature and "standardized" than regular, sequential programming. As a result, we express concurrency differently depending on which concurrent programming model the language is supporting. A brief overview of the most popular concurrency models can help you understand how asynchronous programming fits within the broader field of concurrent programming:

- **OS threads**
- **Event-driven programming**
- **Coroutines, green threads**
- **Actor model**
- **Async**

---

# OS threads

- The "original" way ‚Äî lot of software are written this way

- Spawn an OS thread, do the work on that thread, then synchronize

- Synchronization is hard

- Large\(r) performance overhead, not suitable for massive IO bound workloads <span v-click> (yea, yea, threadpools..) </span>

---

# Event-driven programming

- The "callback" way

- Very verbose, "non-linear" control flow

- Data and errors are usually hard to follow

---

# Coroutines, green threads

- TODO: This is a very hairy topic, and there're generators even... https://stackoverflow.com/a/31151932/11751294 & https://stackoverflow.com/a/553745/11751294
  Needs a better explanation, and maybe separate the two topic a bit. An example could be good, and this may be useful: https://dev.to/thibmaek/explain-coroutines-like-im-five-2d9
  Also emphasize: you explicitly call suspend/resume, not like async await.

- Basically functions, that can be suspended and resumed.

- Supports large number of tasks

- Usually they're multiplexed dynamically to OS threads

- The `yield` keyword in Python, C#, Rust, etc..

- To even confuse you more, Go's goroutines are green threads really.

---

# Actor model

- Divides all computations into small units, called actors

- Actors communicate via message passing

- Actors can only make _local_ decisions:

  - start new actors
  - read messages and decide what to do with them
  - send message to others

- Real shared state and retry logic are usually a pain

---

# Async

- The modern way of concurrency, it's becoming supported in increasingly more languages.

- It lets you run a large number of concurrent tasks on a small number (can be even 1) of OS threads

- Tries to preserve much of the look and feel of ordinary synchronous programming, through the async/await syntax.

---

# Talk about OS vs lightweight threads - probably it's good to base this on the analogy.
---

# Code

```rust {all|11-16|6-8|all}
//! ```cargo
//! [dependencies]
//! reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["blocking"] }

    for user in ["A", "B", "C", "D"] {
        println!("{}", get_user(user));
    }
}

fn get_user(name: &str) -> String {
    reqwest::blocking::get(format!("http://127.0.0.1:3001/{name}"))
        .unwrap()
        .text()
        .unwrap()

# JavaScript?

  return fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:3001/${user}`).then((resp) => resp.text());

  getUser(user).then((res) => console.log(res));

# join

- a.k.a. _all_, _gather_, _await_many_,  ..

- Wait for multiple concurrent branches to complete, returning when **all** of them complete, or there was an error.

- Short-circuit on errors.

# TODO: maybe an useful example would be better for all..

```js
await Promise.all([promise1, promise2, ...promises])
```
- Either rejects completely, or returns all of the results in order.

---

# try_join

- a.k.a. _Promise.allSettled_

- Wait for multiple concurrent branches to complete, returning when **all** of them complete.

- Continue on errors.<sup>1</sup>

```js
await Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, ...promises])
```

- Returns a single promise, describing the outcome of each branch, and it resolved when all of the input's promises resolve/reject.

<sup>1</sup> <text class="opacity-40">On error, the other branches are still running, they don't get cancelled.</text>
---

# select

- a.k.a. _Promise.race_, _WhenAny_, ...

- Launch all branches _concurrently_, then return with the first result when it resolves, or if there was an error.

- Short-circuit on errors.

```js
await Promise.race([promise1, promise2, ...promises])
```

---

# try_select

- a.k.a. _Promise.any_

- Launch all branches _concurrently_, then return with the first result when it completes regardless of the result.

```js
await Promise.any([promise1, promise2, ...promises])
```

# Structured concurrency

# Channels

# Streams

# Async Cancellation

# maybe an interesting example here?

- more use cases here?

# Gotchas

- message passing with channels > shared memory (usually)
