# Hello, async world!

An introductory presentation about concurrency.

To start the slide show:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- visit http://localhost:3030


## Examples

There're a lot of examples in the `/examples` folder. Almost all of them expect the local server to be running.
First, go into `examples/server`, and start the server: 

```bash
cargo r --release
```

Now you're ready to experiment with the examples.
